## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of histopathRshiny from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("histopathRshiny") -->
<!-- ``` -->

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sbalci/histopathRshiny")
```


Launch here: https://serdarbalci.shinyapps.io/histopathR/

Run in your own computer R session:

```r
library(shiny)
runUrl("https://github.com/sbalci/histopathRshiny/raw/master/histopathRshiny.tar")
```

```r
shiny::runGitHub('sbalci/histopathRshiny')
```



<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(histopathRshiny) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
